        <p>I find engineering very satisfying. It's the art of turning ideas 
            into tangible objects. It can solve problems, or improve life, or 
            create entertainment. For now I'll stick to the fun part.
        </p>
        <p>In the engineering class I took during my junior year at 
            Masconomet, I made a few original designs using Onshape, a 
            web-based CAD modeling software. They're designed to be assembled 
            from laser cut pieces.

        <p>This is a toy pickup truck with a working trunk. It’s assembled by 
            gluing together laser cut balsa wood pieces using box joints. This 
            was the first CAD model that I designed for engineering class, and 
            it taught me important fundamental skills, like designing in 
            context. It also helped me to learn more advanced Onshape features, 
            like patterns and the “use” tool.

        <p>I decided to design a pickup truck because I wanted to have 
            a fun trunk to carry little stuff in. I looked at real trucks to get 
            an idea of the proportions for each vertical and horizontal section, 
            the positioning and design for the wheels, and the overall shape of 
            the combined sections.
        </p>
        <p>The project was very satisfying for me. I liked planning out how all 
            the pieces would fit together when I sketched it on paper, 
            especially the dowel holders on the trunk door. The trunk actually 
            ended up being able to lock into place because of the resistance 
            from the sides as it rotates down, which is a nice unintentional 
            feature. The truck is a nice little toy to have around, and it’s 
            great to have something cool in real life that I designed myself.
